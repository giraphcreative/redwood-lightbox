## Redwood Lightbox Slideshow
This project creates a popup modal (lightbox) with a slideshow inside it that walks through the features of the new Redwood site. To install development modules and get things going, the following commands will be helpful.

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/giraphcreative/redwood-lightbox.git

# change to the directory
cd redwood-lightbox

# install required packages via node package manager
npm install

# run grunt to continually watch source files and compile/minify things.
grunt
```

That should do the trick. The un-minified source files are in css/src and js/src respectively. Have fun!
